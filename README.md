## Radio Set Group

this block is just the radio set group, but we just put it in our catigory so you can find it easier.
``` blocks
Multiplayer.setup(10)
```
its that easy!

## Create sprite where?

this block is also a copy. but this is the create sprite from the game caticory.
``` blocks
let sprite = Multiplayer.create(0, 0, 0)
```
Its That Easy!

## Raido move send

this one is a doosy. when you move your microbit up, the sprite moves up, then sends the move up to the other microbit for them to see you move!
``` blocks
Multiplayer.movesend(0)
```
Its THAT Easy!!
